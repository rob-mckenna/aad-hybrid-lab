# Azure Active Directory Hybrid Lab
## Creates an AD VM with Azure AD Connect installed
## Quick Start

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frob-mckenna%2Faad-hybrid-lab%2Fmaster%2Faad-hybrid-lab%2Fdeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a>

## Details
* Deploys the following infrastructure:
 * Virtual Network
  * 1 subnet
  * 1 Network Security Groups
    * AD - permits AD traffic, RDP incoming to network; limits DMZ access
  * Public IP Address
  * AD VM
	* DSC installs AD
    * The Azure vNet is updated with a custom DNS entry pointing to the DC
    * Test users are created in the local AD by passing in an array. There is an array sample set as the default value in the deployment template.
    * Azure Active Directory Connect is installed and available to configure.

## Notes
* The NSG is defined for reference, but is isn't production-ready as holes are also opened for RDP, and public IPs are allocated
* One VM size is specified for all VMs

## NOTICE/WARNING
* This template is explicitly designed for a lab/classroom environment. A few compromises were made, especially with regards to credential passing to DSC and script automation, that WILL result in clear text passwords being left behind in the DSC/scriptextension package folders, Azure log folders, and system event logs on the resulting VMs. 

## Bonus
The "deploy.ps1" file above can be downloaded and run locally against this repo, and offers a few additional features:
* After the deployment completes, it will create a folder on your desktop with the name of the resource group
* It will then create an RDP connection in that folder for the DC VM.
* It will generate a text file with your test user names
